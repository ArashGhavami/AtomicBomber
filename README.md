# AtomicBomber
Atomic Bomber is a 2D Java game built with JavaFX where you pilot a bomber plane and drop bombs to destroy trees and houses. The game features smooth controls, simple physics, and interactive explosions for a fun arcade-style experience.

## ðŸŽ¯ Game Strategy

In Atomic Bomber, you control a bomber plane flying across the battlefield. Your mission is to destroy ground targets such as tanks, trucks, bunkers, trees, and buildings while avoiding enemy fire. Each successful hit increases your score and helps you advance through different waves.
Stay alert â€” enemy tanks and fighter jets will attack as you progress. Strategic bomb placement and quick reaction are key to surviving longer and maximizing your kills.

## ðŸŽ® Game Controls

Use W, A, S, D or the arrow keys to move the plane across the screen. Press Space to drop a regular bomb, R to release a radioactive bomb, and C to launch a cluster bomb. Press Tab to freeze or unfreeze the game, and Esc to pause and open the menu. For cheat codes, press P to skip to the next wave, G to gain a radioactive bomb, Ctrl to obtain a cluster bomb, T to add a tank to the map, and H to restore your planeâ€™s life.
